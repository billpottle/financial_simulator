# Financial Simulator
Flexible Monte Carlo simulator for personal finance

A major financial goal that many people have is being able to afford to retire, broadly defined as being able to stop working and not run out of money before death. An easier goal is to be able to afford to work in an area you are passionate about but that might pay less. Another, related but more difficult goal to achieve is what I call 'Financial Escape Velocity', or being able to increase your net worth through passive and investment income. Those who achieve FEV will generally have their net worth increase with age.
