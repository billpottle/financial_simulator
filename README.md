# Financial Simulator
Flexible Monte Carlo simulator for personal finance with PDF output of charts and tables

A major financial goal that many people have is being able to afford to retire, broadly defined as being able to stop working and not run out of money before death. An easier goal is to be able to afford to work in an area you are passionate about but that might pay less. Another, related but more difficult goal to achieve is what I call 'Financial Escape Velocity', or being able to increase your net worth through passive and investment income. Those who achieve FEV will generally have their net worth increase with age. 

_It's hard to make predictions - especially about the future._ Yogi Berra

If no one ever had any unexpected expenses, and you could predict the return of every asset class perfectly, then personal finance would be easy because there would be one 'right' or 'best' answer. However, the real world there is a lot of uncertainty. This program models this using a 'Monte Carlo' approach - basically running many random simulations and doing statistics on the result. 

*How to Use*

Edit the values in inputs.csv before running the simulation. Here is the meaning of each column

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Random Seed     | Change this value if you want to run the simulation again with the same parameters      |
| Years   | The number of years you want to simulate.        |
